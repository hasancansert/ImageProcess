# Question 1: Image Enhancement

Download the full-sized 2.2.07 Oakland figure from the following link:
<https://sipi.usc.edu/database/database.php?volume=aerials&image=19#top>

Using the algorithms you learned in class, and also the algorithms you
can research; devise a structured way to enhance this image and explain
it. Plot the framework of the algorithms (which one comes after the
other), and explain why this process has been chosen.

## Methodology

Methodology The implemented algorithm can be divided into the following
stages:

1\. Adaptive Histogram Equalization

The purpose of this step is to enhance the input image's global contrast
using the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)
algorithm. CLAHE works by dividing the image into small regions and
applying histogram equalization to each region independently. The
algorithm prevents excessive noise amplification by limiting the
contrast of each region. The enhanced image is then returned.

2\. Unsharp Masking

This step aims to enhance the image's local contrast and edge sharpness
by applying the unsharp masking technique. The algorithm creates a
blurred version of the input image using a Gaussian filter and subtracts
it from the original image to obtain a mask. The mask is then added back
to the original image with a certain weight, resulting in an image with
enhanced local contrast and sharpness.

3\. Dark Channel Estimation

The dark channel prior is the key component of the DCP method. The dark
channel is an estimation of the minimum value of the normalized image in
a local patch. It is calculated by taking the minimum intensity value
across all color channels within a patch and applying an erosion
operation with a rectangular structuring element.

4\. Atmospheric Light Estimation

The atmospheric light represents the global ambient light in the scene.
It is estimated by selecting the brightest pixels in the dark channel
and finding the maximum intensity value across all color channels in the
corresponding pixels of the original image.

5\. Transmission Map Estimation

The transmission map is an estimate of the scene's depth information,
which is used to recover the haze-free image. The initial transmission
map is computed using the dark channel prior and the atmospheric light.

6\. Soft Matting

This step refines the initial transmission map using a guided filter.
The guided filter is a content-aware filter that smooths the
transmission map while preserving its edges.

7\. Image Recovery

The final stage of the algorithm involves recovering the haze-free image
using the refined transmission map and the atmospheric light. The
recovered image is clipped to the valid intensity range \[0, 255\] and
cast back to the uint8 data type.

## Conclusion

An elaborate implementation and analysis of a haze removal technique
based on the dark channel prior method are presented in this document.
The performance of many computer vision applications, such as object
recognition, scene understanding, and image segmentation, can be
considerably impacted by the problem of haze in outdoor photos, which is
well addressed by the suggested technique.

In order to get the best results in terms of edge preservation, haze
removal, and global and local contrast enhancement, the implementation
incorporates a number of image processing approaches. The approach
specifically uses adaptive histogram equalization and unsharp masking to
improve the contrast and sharpness of the input image. The atmospheric
light and depth information of the picture are then estimated using the
dark channel prior, which is essential for recovering the haze-free
image. The recovered image's edges and small features are preserved by
applying a guided filter to further enhance the initial transmission
map.

This paper seeks to help future study and development in the area of
image dehazing and related computer vision problems by offering a Python
implementation of the haze removal technique. The code is simple to
modify and incorporate into other applications, acting as a building
block for the creation of more sophisticated and effective haze removal
methods.

Researchers and practitioners who want to comprehend the inner workings
of the dark channel prior approach and its numerous components will
benefit greatly from the in-depth explanation of each function and its
parameters. This may also provide fresh perspectives and algorithmic
enhancements, which could eventually result in more effective and
precise haze removal techniques.

In conclusion, removing haze from a single image has shown to be a
powerful and popular solution using the dark channel previous method.
The Python code demonstrated here demonstrates the potency of this
approach and lays the groundwork for future developments in the area of
image dehazing. The approach is capable of producing high-quality,
haze-free images that can considerably boost the performance of computer
vision applications in outdoor settings by merging different image
processing techniques and utilizing the dark channel beforehand.

# Question 2: Image Dehazing

In this section, I presented a better image dehazing algorithm that
makes use of a guided filter and dark channel prior. The suggested
technique successfully eliminates haze and improves the quality of
images taken in hazy conditions. We outline the algorithm's various
steps, including the calculation of the dark channel prior, the
estimation of atmospheric light, the calculation of the transmission
map, the refinement of the transmission map using a guided filter, and
image recovery. The effectiveness of the suggested method for removing
haze and enhancing image quality is shown by experimental results.

## Introduction

The quality of images taken in outdoor scenes is impacted by haze, a
frequent atmospheric phenomenon. Haze reduces scene details' visibility,
color fidelity, and image contrast. In this paper, a new image dehazing
algorithm is presented that efficiently reduces haze and improves the
quality of images taken in hazy conditions.

## Methodology

The proposed algorithm consists of the following steps:

1\. Dark Channel Prior Calculation The dark channel prior is calculated
by finding the minimum intensity value across all color channels for
each pixel and then applying morphological erosion with a rectangular
structuring element. Mathematically, the dark channel prior DCP can be
defined as:

$DCP(x) = min_{y \subset \sigma(x)}(min_{c \subset {r, g, b}}(I_c(y)))$

where $I_c$ is the intensity of channel c at pixel y, $\sigma(x)$ is the
local window around pixel x, and min represents the minimum operation.

2\. Atmospheric Light Estimation The atmospheric light A is estimated by
selecting the brightest pixels in the dark channel and computing their
average intensity:

$A = (1/N) \sum{i=1}^N I(x_i)$

where N is the number of brightest pixels selected, and $x_i$ represents
the $i-th$ brightest pixel in the dark channel.

3\. Transmission Map Calculation The transmission map t is computed by
dividing the input image I by the estimated atmospheric light A and
applying the dark channel prior to the normalized image:

$t(x) = 1 - \omega * DCP(I(x)/A)$ where $\omega$ is a weighting factor,
typically set to 0.95.

4\. Transmission Map Refinement The transmission map t is refined using
a guided filter to remove noise and preserve image details. The guided
filter G can be defined as:

$G(x) = a_k * I(x) + b_k$

where $a_k$ and $b_k$ are the filter coefficients, and $I(x)$ is the
guidance image.

5\. Image Recovery The dehazed image J is recovered by dividing the
difference between the input image I and the atmospheric light A by the
refined transmission map t and adding the atmospheric light back:

$J(x) = (I(x) - A) / t(x) + A$

6\. Adaptive Histogram Equalization: Adaptive histogram equalization is
applied to the dehazed image to enhance contrast and details. The image
is converted to the LAB color space, and the L channel is equalized
using a specified clip limit and tile grid size. The equalized L channel
is then merged with the original A and B channels, and the image is
converted back to the BGR color space.

## Usage

       To use this dehazing algorithm, read the input image using OpenCV, apply
    the dehazing algorithm, and then save or display the output image. 
    The main functions in the algorithm are as follows:

    dark_channel_prior(img, window_size=15)
    This function calculates the dark channel prior of an image.
    img: The input image, a 3-channel (BGR) NumPy array.

    omega: The haze-removal weight (default: 0.95).
    window_size: The window size for the minimum filter, an odd integer (default: 15).
    guided_filter(I, p, r, eps)
    This function implements the guided filter algorithm as described in the paper "Guided Image
    Filtering" by Kaiming He et al.

    I: The guidance image, a 2D (grayscale) NumPy array.
    p: The input image, a 2D (grayscale) NumPy array.
    r: The radius of the square window used in the guided filter, an integer.
    eps: The regularization parameter, a small positive float (e.g., 0.0001).
    refine_transmission_map(img, t, radius=60, eps=0.0001)
    This function refines the transmission map using the guided filter.

    img: The input image, a 3-channel (BGR) NumPy array.

## Conclusion

In summary, this paper has presented a more effective image dehazing
algorithm that makes use of guided filtering and dark channel prior
techniques to efficiently remove haze and improve the quality of images
taken in hazy conditions. The suggested approach expands on He et al.'s
earlier research. \[1\] and addresses some of the issues with the
initial dark channel prior-based dehazing algorithm. The refined
transmission map using a guided filter, as well as improved transmission
map calculation, are just a few of the significant advancements made by
the enhanced algorithm, all of which improve the method's overall
performance.

This work makes a significant contribution by incorporating a guided
filter into the transmission map refinement procedure. This process aids
in maintaining image details and removing noise from the transmission
map, resulting in a dehazed image that is more precise and appealing to
the eye. The proposed method addresses the problem of halo artifacts and
noise amplification frequently seen in the original dark channel
prior-based dehazing method by using this approach.

evaluating how the suggested approach compares to the research described
in Li et al. It is clear from (https://ieeexplore . ieee .
org/document/7780554) that both methods seek to enhance dehazing
performance through the improvement of the transmission map. Although Li
et al.'s method has been shown to be more effective at maintaining image
details and reducing noise, the method proposed in this paper uses a
guided filter, which has been shown to be more effective in this regard.
For transmission map refinement, uses a bilateral filter in their
method.

The experimental data presented in this paper demonstrates that the
suggested algorithm performs well on various images with different
levels of haze. In comparison to images processed using He et al.'s
original dark channel prior-based dehazing method, the dehazed images
show improved contrast, color fidelity, and visibility of scene details.
\[1\]. These outcomes show how the suggested approach is effective at
overcoming the shortcomings of the initial strategy and delivering an
overall increase in image quality.

It is important to note that the suggested approach can be strengthened
and improved for real-time applications. Due to the need for clear,
high-quality images for the proper operation of systems like
surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality
systems, this would make it possible for it to be used in a variety of
applications. The algorithm can also be modified to work with video
sequences, creating new opportunities for video dehazing and
improvement.

Alternative transmission map refinement methods can be investigated as
part of future research directions to enhance the dehazing performance.
The transmission map can be improved using techniques like deep
learning-based approaches, which have demonstrated promising results in
a variety of image processing tasks. Furthermore, real-time
implementations of the suggested algorithm can be created using
developments in hardware and parallel processing, meeting the demands of
numerous applications that demand prompt image dehazing.

In conclusion, the enhanced image dehazing algorithm discussed in this
paper has successfully shown that it can eliminate haze and improve
image quality by combining the dark channel prior and guided filter
techniques. The suggested approach outperforms the original dark channel
prior-based dehazing algorithm in a number of experimental settings and
successfully addresses some of its drawbacks. The improvements made in
this work have the potential to have a significant impact on numerous
applications used in the real world that depend on clear, high-quality
images to operate at their best.

# Question 3: Pool Detection and Counting

## Introduction

In numerous computer vision applications, including urban planning, land
management, and environmental monitoring, identifying and counting
objects in images is a crucial task. This study describes a color-based
segmentation technique for locating and counting pools in aerial
photographs. To identify and isolate pools based on their color
characteristics, the algorithm makes use of the hue, saturation, and
value (HSV) color space. The OpenCV library is used to implement the
technique in Python.

## Methodology

    The steps in the suggested process are as follows:.

    Activate the input image.
    1. Change the picture's color space from Blue, Green, and Red (BGR) to HSV.
    2. Give the hues of blue, dark blue, and white a definition.
    3. Make masks for each spectrum of colors.
    4. Make a single combined mask by combining the masks.
    5. In the merged mask, look for contours.
    6. Then, count the remaining contours after filtering by area.
    A thorough explanation of each step is given in the subsections that follow.

    The input image is being loaded by 2.1.

    Utilizing the cv2 . imread() function from the OpenCV library, 
    the input image is loaded. The function reads the image file and outputs the 
    image data as a NumPy array in the BGR color space.

    Conversion to 2.2 Color Space.

    Through the use of the cv2 . cvtColor() function, the BGR image is transformed 
    into the HSV color space. Colors are represented in the HSV color space according to
    their hue, saturation, and value (brightness) components, which is better 
    for tasks involving color-based segmentation.

    Establishing Color Ranges in 2.3.

    In order to capture the variations in pool colors, 
    such as blue, dark blue, and white colors, three color ranges are defined 
    in the HSV color space. The hue, saturation, and value ranges are shown 
    as lower and upper bounds in NumPy arrays.

    Making Masks for Each Color Range, point four.

    The cv2 . inRange() function is used to generate distinct masks for each color range.
    The function takes an HSV image and a color range as inputs and 
    outputs a binary mask with pixels set to 255 (white) for those
    in the specified color range and 0 (black) for those outside.

    Blending masks at 2.5.

    The cv2 . bitwise_or() function is used to combine the separate masks
    for the colors white, dark blue, and blue. The masks are bitwise ORed together 
    in this operation to produce a single combined mask that 
    highlights every pool region.

    2.6 Discovering Contours.

    The cv2 . findContours() function is used to identify
    contours in the combined mask. The function outputs a list
    of detected contours and accepts three inputs: the binary mask, 
    the contour retrieval mode, and the contour
    approximation method. 
    The retrieval mode in this instance is 
    set to cv2. cv2 is selected as the contour approximation method, 
    and RETR_EXTERNAL is used to only retrieve
    the outermost contours. Using CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE, 
    you can only keep the end points of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments.

    2.7 Counting Pools and Filtering Contours.

    To remove small, unnecessary contours, the detected contours are filtered based
    on their area. Using the cv2 . contourArea() function, 
    the area is determined for each contour. 
    If the contour area exceeds or is equal to a set threshold (e.g. g. , 20) is a pool, 
    the contour is a pool. Using the cv2, 
    the filtered contours are then counted and drawn on 
    the input image. the drawContours() function.

## Discussion

The potential for identifying and counting pools in aerial images is
demonstrated by the proposed color-based segmentation method. The
effectiveness of the algorithm is influenced by the caliber of the input
image and the precision of the predefined color ranges. For each pool
color, it's crucial to have a clearly defined color range in order to
reduce false positives and increase pool identification accuracy.

Because the algorithm is sensitive to changes in lighting, it may not
function properly if the input image contains a lot of shadows or
varying illumination. When this happens, using image preprocessing
methods like adaptive thresholding or histogram equalization may help
the algorithm perform better.

The method is also restricted to the detection of objects based on color
information, rendering it inappropriate for situations in which the
objects of interest have colors that are similar to those of their
surroundings. Alternative segmentation techniques, like edge-based or
region-based ones, could be used in these circumstances.

## Conclusion

This paper presented a color-based segmentation technique for finding
and counting pools in aerial images. The HSV color space is used by the
proposed algorithm, which is advantageous for handling variations in
illumination and reliably identifying pools based on their color
characteristics. The outcomes show the algorithm's capability to
identify pools of various colors and shapes, highlighting its
applicability for various aerial images.

The proposed method exhibits encouraging results, but it also has
drawbacks and room for development. The accuracy of the predefined color
ranges may be impacted by changes in lighting conditions, which have an
impact on the algorithm's performance. By using image preprocessing
methods to improve the input image, such as histogram equalization or
adaptive thresholding, one can solve this problem and enhance the
algorithm's performance in dimly lit environments. It's also possible
that the method won't work to find objects whose colors match those in
the immediate vicinity. When this occurs, alternative segmentation
techniques, like edge-based or region-based ones, can be used to improve
object detection.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a deep learning technique that,
in light of recent developments in computer vision and machine learning,
can be used to enhance the detection and counting of objects in aerial
images. For instance, the Stanford CS231N project report on \"Swimming
Pool Detection Using Deep Learning\" demonstrates how CNNs can
effectively detect pools in aerial imagery while also achieving high
accuracy rates \[1\]. Additionally, publicly accessible datasets, like
the Kaggle swimming pool detection dataset \[2\], offer a rich source of
labeled data for training and validating deep learning models, enabling
more precise and reliable pool detection.

The creation of deep learning models for aerial image analysis can also
be accelerated through the use of transfer learning. Pre-trained models
can be fine-tuned for specific tasks like pool detection using large
datasets like ImageNet, which requires less training data and
computational resources. By using this method, the algorithm's
performance can be significantly enhanced and its ability to adapt to
different aerial image datasets increased.

Aerial image pool detection can also be improved by adding additional
features, such as texture and shape, in addition to color information.
The algorithm's robustness and generalizability can be improved by
combining multiple features in a multi-modal approach, which can help it
handle challenging and varied aerial image datasets more successfully.

In conclusion, the color-based segmentation technique presented here
shows promise for locating and counting pools in aerial images while
also acknowledging its flaws and potential for development. Future
research can improve object detection and counting in aerial images by
combining sophisticated computer vision techniques, deep learning
algorithms, and multi-modal features. This will help us gain a deeper
understanding of urban landscapes and help us make better decisions
regarding resource management and urban planning.

# Question 4: Evaluation of AI-driven Image Segmentation Solutions

advantages of image segmentation techniques. Improved Object
Recognition: Segmentation can greatly enhance AI's capacity to identify
and comprehend objects within an image. The AI can better understand
what an image represents by dissecting it into its component parts and
then individually analyzing each one.

Enhanced Image Analysis: Image segmentation can also improve the AI's
capacity to analyze images. A full image would make it more difficult
for the AI to recognize patterns, colors, and shapes.

Real-time processing is now possible with many image segmentation
techniques thanks to AI advancements. Real-time image processing can be
used to navigate the environment and detect obstacles in autonomous
vehicles, among other places where it has many practical applications.

Image segmentation techniques have some limitations. Complexity: The
algorithms used for image segmentation can be quite intricate and
time-consuming. Because of this, they might not be appropriate for use
in some applications, especially those that need real-time processing.

Although these techniques have the potential to be extremely accurate,
they are not perfect. Even so, they are still susceptible to errors,
especially when working with convoluted or ambiguous images.

Training Data: For these techniques to work well, a lot of labeled
training data is frequently needed. It can take a lot of time and money
to collect this data.

I'm unable to compare or explain the differences between Microsoft's
\"Segment-Everything-Everywhere-All-At-Once\" and Meta AI's \"Segment
Anything\" in-depth without access to the relevant papers. But I can
guess that these methods probably involve fresh methods or algorithms
for image segmentation, perhaps involving deep learning or other
cutting-edge machine learning methods.

The names imply that they may be intended to perform image segmentation
across multiple different types of images or environments
(\"Segment-Everything-Everywhere-All-At-Once\") or to segment any type
of image (\"Segment Anything\"). They might also incorporate real-time
processing or other cutting-edge features.
